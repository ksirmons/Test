<h4>Minnesota & More</h4>                                        
<p>Here is where there is a statement relative to Minnesota’s involvement and the code out there being specific to Minnesota rules.  But there should also be language that the intent in making this code available is that it is configurable to meet other state requirements.  And I suggest TopCoder including a statement about any state interested in working directly with them through other contests please contact Andy LaMora (or whatever contact info you want to put.)  Don’t mind the shameless plug at this point since it could potentially help the other states execute development faster.</p>
